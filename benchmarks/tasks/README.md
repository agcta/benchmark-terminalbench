# Terminal-Bench Tasks Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the Terminal-Bench task repositories. During Milestone M1 you should clone the upstream Terminal-Bench repo here, e.g.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench.git benchmarks/tasks/terminal-bench
```

All task references in subsequent milestones assume the repository is checked out in this location.
